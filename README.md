# Cookbook

This is a project I completed as a school assignment. The task was to create a database along with a graphical application that interacts with it. The main requirements for the database included having at least three tables, indexing on columns, at least one stored procedure, and a view. Additionally, the database should adhere to the third normal form (3NF) and have a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) user interface. The user should be able to view data from the database, save new data, and update/delete existing data through the application.

The application is built using WPF and is divided into two main sections: one for recipes and one for ingredients. In the recipe section, users can create their own recipes and view/edit/delete existing ones. In the ingredients section, users can add new ingredients and view/delete existing ones. The database comprises six tables, and the application functions are primarily connected to stored procedures in the database.
